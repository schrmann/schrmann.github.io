'Have you ever asked yourself why alcohol plays such a big role in so many peopleâ€˜s lives?\nWhy is it almost unthinkable to have a celebration, in the western world, without it?\nWhy is the ability to drink large amounts of alcohol still considered an ideal of masculinity and strength?\nWhy do we believe that we can access our true hidden emotions through alcohol?\nWhy do we feel so terrible after a night of drinking and still dismiss this state as normal and insignificant?\nAnd why is it almost frowned upon to refer to alcohol as a dangerous drug, although the evidence for this is almost impossible to deny?'
